# Deadpool Bleeds

Little game I made where the goal is to bleed on every square on Hugh Jackman photo :)

If it doesn't works because of SDL2: ` sh download_brew.sh ` and then ` sh download_sdl2.sh `
If it still doesn't works contact me.

If do you want to change the Window Size or the Map Size or the Amounth of Squares to bleed on => Open ` includes/const_vars.c `

Change : 
  ` WIDTH	 &  HEIGHT  for Window size `
 Â ` rWIDTH & rHEIGHT  for Map size    `
  ` MAPnb             for Amouth of Squares to bleed on`

If you want to have fun changing the Square size or Deadpool img size or the speed, it's also in ` includes/const_vars.h `

# Well , Have Fun :D
